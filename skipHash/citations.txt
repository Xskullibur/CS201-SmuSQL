Queries made to GPT 4o to create skipHash implementation

1. Please help me finish the implementation of the Table class, which is supposed to emulate an SQL table. Provided as well is the skipList indexing version created for you to use as a reference. <insert fields for hash implementation, and Table from skipListIndexing>
2. using these fields, help me create a returnKeysByRequirementsOnIndex method for the hashmap rows + skiplist indexing Table.java <insert the fields again>
3. help me change the implementation of Engine.java to accomodate my new table structure and methods <insert skipListIndexing Engine.java>
4. help me create the insert logic
5. since all the column values are indexed, there is no need for returnKeysByRequirementsOnId. Use the methdos available in the new Table.java to fix the applyDeleteLogic
6. help me create the method for the apply select logic as well
7. now help me make the create table and update table logic under engine.java
8. extract the applyUpdateLogic method (i wanted to refactor the code so i can manually debug something)
9. help me change this part in the insert statmemnt such that strings are properly isnserted when using parenthesis such as 'hello' (so that i can pass the Test cases provided by Alson)
10. help me debug <insert various error messages from testing>
11. help me handle the case where the operator = '!=' <insert code for returnKeysByRequirementsOnIndex()>

1. These two tests are failing. Help me figure out why. ValuesGreaterThan stops too late and valuesLesserThanOrEquals stops too early. provided is the implementations as well
2. help me fix this as well <insert test case that failed> , the problem was that 0 rows were returned. Heres my equals method in indexing adn how it works in the skiplist: <insert equals method> <insert terminal with bugs> I cannot select when the city is 'Los Angeles'. What might be causing this issue?
