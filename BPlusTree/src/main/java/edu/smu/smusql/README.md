# B+ Tree Implementation Analysis

## 1. Search Operation
### Implementation Analysis
- The search starts from the root and traverses down to leaf nodes
- At each internal node:
  - Binary search is used to find the correct child pointer
  - Moves to the next level
- At leaf node:
  - Direct lookup using `indexOf`
  - Returns all values associated with the key

### Time Complexity
- Height of tree: O(log_m n) where m is order of tree, n is number of keys
- Search within node: O(log m) using binary search
- **Overall Complexity: O(log n)**

## 2. Insert Operation
### Implementation Analysis
- Traverses to appropriate leaf node
- For main tree:
  - Each key has exactly one value
  - No duplicate keys allowed
- For index trees:
  - Multiple values can exist for same key
  - Handled by storing List<V> as values
- Handles node splitting when overflow occurs
- Updates parent nodes recursively if needed

### Time Complexity
- Finding insertion point: O(log n)
- Insertion in leaf: O(1) amortized
- Node split (worst case): O(m) where m is order of tree
- **Overall Complexity: O(log n)**

## 3. Delete Operation
### Implementation Analysis
Two deletion methods:
1. `removeKey(K key)`: Removes entire key and all associated values
2. `removeValue(K key, V value)`: Removes specific value for a key

Features:
- Handles underflow through borrowing and merging
- Updates parent nodes recursively
- Maintains B+ tree properties
- Adjusts first leaf pointer if needed

### Time Complexity
- Finding deletion point: O(log n)
- Deletion from leaf: O(1)
- Rebalancing (worst case): O(log n)
- **Overall Complexity: O(log n)**

## 4. Update Operation
### Implementation Analysis
Three types of updates:
1. `update(K key, V newValue)`: Updates all values for a key
2. `updateValue(K key, V oldValue, V newValue)`: Updates specific value
3. `updateKey(K oldKey, K newKey)`: Updates key while maintaining values

Features:
- Validates existence of keys
- Handles value lists appropriately
- Maintains tree properties

### Time Complexity
- Finding update point: O(log n)
- Basic update: O(1)
- Key update (involves delete + insert): O(log n)
- **Overall Complexity: O(log n)**

## 5. Range Search Operation
### Implementation Analysis
- Finds starting key using tree traversal
- Uses leaf node links to scan sequential nodes
- Collects all values within range
- Takes advantage of B+ tree's sequential access properties

### Time Complexity
- Finding start point: O(log n)
- Scanning range: O(k) where k is number of keys in range
- **Overall Complexity: O(log n + k)**

## Special Considerations for Your SQL Implementation

### Main Tree (Primary Key Tree)
- Optimized for single value per key
- Guarantees unique keys
- Values are full row data (HashMap)
- **Best for**: Primary key lookups, full row retrieval

### Index Trees
- Allows multiple values per key
- Values are primary keys
- Supports non-unique fields
- **Best for**: Secondary index queries, range queries

### Performance Implications
1. **Select Operations**
   - Using primary key: O(log n)
   - Using indexed field: O(log n)
   - Range queries: O(log n + k)

2. **Insert Operations**
   - Main tree: O(log n)
   - Each index tree: O(log n)
   - Total: O(i * log n) where i is number of indexes

3. **Delete Operations**
   - Main tree: O(log n)
   - Each index tree: O(log n)
   - Total: O(i * log n)

4. **Update Operations**
   - Simple value update: O(log n)
   - Key update affecting indexes: O(i * log n)

## Recommendations
1. **Index Optimization**
   - Carefully choose which fields to index
   - Each index adds overhead to insert/update/delete
   - Consider query patterns when deciding indexes

2. **Tree Order Selection**
   - Larger order = fewer levels but more comparison time
   - Smaller order = more levels but faster node operations
   - Consider memory constraints and access patterns

3. **Performance Tuning**
   - Monitor tree height and node utilization
   - Consider bulk loading for large initial datasets
   - Implement periodic rebalancing if needed
